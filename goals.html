                <p>Health is Wealth. At the Wellness Garden, when we think about wellness, we think about it from the
                    perspective of our mind, body, spirit, emotions, and community. The American College of Lifestyle
                    Medicine looks at six interconnected pillars of health when thinking about our overall health and
                    wellbeing: mental health, substances, sleep, social relationships, nutrition, and movement.</p>

                <p>Up until very recently, Mental Health was not considered a very important part of our overall health
                    and wellbeing. Yet, mental health issues contribute to many of the physical health issues that pop
                    up throughout our lifespan. Someone who is super depressed may not have the motivation to live an
                    active lifestyle,socially isolate, and have no hope for their future. They may stop taking care of
                    their physical bodies,disengage from community, and spiral downwards.</p>

                <p>You'll find a ton of resources for all of the pillars here. We focus on the mental and social aspects
                    of our health and wellbeing heavily at The Wellness Graden as our team comes from diverse
                    disciplines within the mental and
                    behavioral health field.</p>

                    struggling with Drug Addiction?!!</h4>
                <p>Drug addiction, also called substance use disorder, is a disease that affects a person's brain and
                    behavior and leads to an inability to control the use of a legal or illegal drug or medicine.
                    Substances such as alcohol, marijuana and nicotine also are considered drugs.</p>
                <p>Treatments for drug addiction include counseling, medicines, or both. Research shows that combining
                    medicines with counseling gives most people the best chance of success. The counseling may be
                    individual, family, and/or group therapy.</p>
                <p>
                    The ultimate goal of The Wellness Garden is therefore to create opportunity for behavior change through helping the drug addicts to curb psychological, physical and emotional problems
                    brought about by the drugs.</p>
